# rash

**R**ust **a**gain **sh***ell

## Overview

Rash? I don't know. I needed an adjacent name that was also inherently discouraging to curious users. This is written in Rust but that does not mean this is inherently safe -- it's a shell. Small mistakes in Shells can ruin your whole machine. Be Careful.

This does not aim to be a fully featured bash replacement. It's intentionally slimmed down from the [POSIX specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/).

## Usage

```shell
./rash
>
```
